Start a new spec for: **$ARGUMENTS**

Follow the Pro Clinic spec-driven workflow. Read the constitution first:
@.claude/spec-kit/constitution.md and the template @.claude/spec-kit/spec-template.md.

Steps:
1. **Resolve the issue.**
   - If `$ARGUMENTS` is a number: try `gh issue view <n> --json number,title,body,labels`. If the GitHub CLI (`gh`) is missing or errors, ask
     the user to paste the issue title + body — do not fail.
   - If `$ARGUMENTS` is a description: no issue yet. Use `#TBD` and leave a
     `[NEEDS CLARIFICATION: assign issue #]` marker.
2. **Derive a short name** — 2–4 kebab-case words from the issue title.
3. **Set up the branch.** Determine the parent `feature/<name>` — the GitHub Project the
   issue belongs to. **Always ask which `feature/*` branch the branch should be based on** —
   never assume, never default to `main`/`develop`. List available feature branches
   (`git branch -a --list "*feature/*"`) and ask via `AskUserQuestion`.
   - If already on `NNN-<kort>` matching this issue, keep it — no sync.
   - Otherwise: `git checkout feature/<name> && git pull`, then **sync the feature branch with
     `develop` (below)**, and only then create and link the branch with `gh issue develop <n> --base feature/<name> --name <nr>-<short> --checkout`. Linking
     is what lets the tracker close the issue when the branch merges. If the link step is
     unavailable, fall back to `git checkout -b NNN-<kort>` and say it was not linked.
   - For a description-based spec (no issue yet): `git checkout -b NNN-<kort>`; no sync.
   - Respect the constitution's PR-direction rule; issue branches never target `main`/`develop`.
   - **Sync `feature/<name>` with `develop` before cutting the issue branch**, so the new branch is
     born with everything already integrated instead of discovering the drift as conflicts in its PR:
     1. `git status --porcelain --untracked-files=no -- . ':(exclude).claude/settings.local.json'` —
        if that reports anything, **stop** and list the files. Commit or stash them yourself; never
        stash, merge over, or commit on the user's behalf. The exclusions are deliberate:
        `.claude/settings.local.json` is machine-local and `/push` never commits it, so a plain
        `git status --porcelain` would block every run; untracked files are ignored because a merge
        does not touch them (git refuses on its own if one is in the way).
     2. `git fetch origin develop`, then `git log feature/<name>..origin/develop --oneline`. Empty
        means in sync — skip straight to creating the branch, no empty merge commit.
     3. Otherwise `git merge origin/develop` into `feature/<name>` and push it. On conflict, **stop**
        and name the conflicting files; **leave the half-merged tree in place** (never `git merge
        --abort`) so no resolution work is thrown away, and continue once it is committed. If the push
        is rejected, `git pull` and retry it once, then stop and report.
   - `develop` is merged **into the feature branch**, never straight into an issue branch — that would
     drag unrelated history into the issue's PR to `feature/<name>`.
   - **The sync is blocking, not best-effort:** any failure — conflict, dirty tree, rejected push, no
     network — stops spec creation with the problem named, rather than cutting a branch from stale code.
4. **Scaffold `specs/NNN-<kort>.md`** from the template. Fill the header, User story, and an initial
   Acceptance criteria list. Leave Background/Exact changes for `/implement`. Mark every unknown with
   `[NEEDS CLARIFICATION: …]`.
5. Report the created file path, the branch, and the count of `[NEEDS CLARIFICATION]` markers. Say
   whether `feature/<name>` was synced with `develop` and how many commits it brought in (or that it
   was already in sync). Then suggest running `/clarify`.
