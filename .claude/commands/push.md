Commit and push the current branch. Commit message (if needed): **$ARGUMENTS**.

1. **Branch guard.** Get the current branch. If it is `main` or `develop`, **stop** and refuse — those
   only receive changes via PR (see @.claude/spec-kit/constitution.md). Otherwise continue.
2. **Pending changes?** Run `git status --short`.
   - If there are uncommitted changes and `$ARGUMENTS` is empty, reply with only this line and stop:
     > What should the commit message be? (type "y" and I'll write a concise one)
   - If there are uncommitted changes, determine the message:
     - `$ARGUMENTS` is `y`/`Y` → generate a concise one-line message from the diff, imperative mood.
     - otherwise → use `$ARGUMENTS` verbatim.
     Then stage everything **except** `.claude/settings.local.json` and commit with that message plus
     the trailer `Co-Authored-By: Claude <noreply@anthropic.com>`.
   - If nothing to commit: skip to push.
3. **Push.** `git push` — add `-u origin <branch>` if no upstream yet. **Never** force-push, never
   skip hooks.
4. **Report** branch, commit (if any), and push result. If it's a `feature/*` branch, note the push
   auto-deploys to DEV; `<nr>-kort` issue branches do not deploy.

Do not open a PR — use `/pr-check` then the PR command.
